# zrootresume

Tradional resume  is papar or just fields,rows of database.The down side is clear.It's static,the resume can not reflect your progress in after your complete it.

Online site profile is better, your stackoverflow profile ,linkin profile ,github profile is dynamic  and can keep up to date .But you still need a thing like Rss reader to merge them together .

Finally I find setup a  repo is a good idea. I can both  track the history, add something  interesting attracting module plugin.

So is this repo born.
